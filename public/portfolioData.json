Born in a small town in Northern BC, I made my move to Victoria where I work as a full stack developer for Instant Domain Search, alongside my many ongoing projects. I love to create and tend to keep a few too many projects on the go at a time. Outside of work I am an avid motorcyclist, soccer player and Muay Thai fighter. I love to travel and lead a fairly nomadic lifestyle. I built much of my early portfolio from beaches of Southeast Asia and dream of being able to take my work with me while travelling the world.",
